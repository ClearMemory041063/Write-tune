### Pay attention to the Syncronization field 

This code depends on a selection being made in the score. The synchronization field and the Sync button, allow this plugin to synchronize the insertion point in the score with the selection in Musescore.

Best practice: Use mouse to mark a selection in th4e score, then click on the Sync button in the plugin.
